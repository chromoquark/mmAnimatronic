I wrote this code to control a small robot I made.  I used an Atmel ATMEGA 128 chip as the microcontroller. It controls a speaker and three motors.  There is a temperature sensor, accelerometer, and a button.  I put these components inside a Mickey Mouse plush to convert it into an interactive toy.
